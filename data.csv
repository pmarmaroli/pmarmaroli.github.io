Testimonials,Samir O. - Data Engineering Technical Leader - Cisco, ,Patrick has very high technical skills in the fields of audio signal processing acoustics and machine/deep learning. He has the rigour of academic world and he is very strong to solve pratical issues with efficient solutions. I have never met someone with his skills in terms of Matlab implementation. I worked with him during 3.5 years mostly under his direction as he was the manager of audio department. He was a very good manager with clear instructions and when I encountered some difficulties Patrick has never hesitated to help technically. In addition Patrick became a friend he is a very kind and nice person. I recommend Patrick to any company. I am sure that he will be a great asset to any "signal processing" "AI" or "Acoustic" team.,
Testimonials,Mathieu L. - Co-Founder & CTO, ,J'ai travaillé avec Patrick pendant 3 ans durant lequel son expertise de l'audio au sens large nous a permis de relever plusieurs défis et d’innover. Patrick est à l’écoute de toutes les nouvelles technologies et sait parfaitement manier les contraintes techniques pour toujours proposer des solutions innovante et pertinente. Je recommande Patrick pour tous vos besoins audio et traitement du signal.,
Testimonials,Maurizio M. - Firmware Team Manager - Eaton,,I have worked with Patrick for more than 4 years at HED and from day one I understood the quality and the high level of engineering skills he has. Patrick is a methodical and very detail oriented engineer. He never leaves a technical point without a clear documentation or explanation. After a few years at HED he got a promotion to the position of audio department manager. Very deserved position where he got his best performance. Patrick is the perfect guide to the whole team when there are storms and tough times and he always finds the best way to get the whole team to a safe place. I highly recommend Patrick to any company with needs of real leaders that make the difference. I really hope to work again with Patrick in the future.,  
Testimonials,Romain B. - Professor HES,,Patrick is a proactive passionate and tireless contributor who would make a great addition to any team. I did my PhD at the same time and he has proved to be incredibly helpful and very knowledgeable especially in programming. He also has a very good technical knowledge in the areas of localization and separation of sound sources using microphone array. I would highly recommend him for any position as he adapts quickly to a team and naturally shares its many skills and hands-on experiences.,
