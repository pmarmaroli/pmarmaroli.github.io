                <h1>About Cheffantastique</h1>
                <p>The development of Cheffantastique.com began in spring 2023, shortly after the public release of
                    ChatGPT
                    3.5. Like many others, I was astonished by the capabilities of generative AI to produce meaningful
                    responses to various prompts. One aspect that quickly became evident was the sensitivity of the AI
                    to
                    the phrasing of prompts. Even minor changes could result in significantly different outcomes. This
                    observation inspired the creation of an interface that could guide users in crafting effective
                    prompts.
                    The theme of cooking was chosen somewhat randomly. Although I am not a chef or particularly
                    passionate
                    about food, this context served well as a proof of concept for the platform.</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p><strong>Cheffantastique.com</strong> is an AI-driven platform designed to generate custom
                    recipes tailored to user preferences. The development process involved several key components,
                    each
                    aimed at
                    creating a seamless and engaging user experience.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>User Interface and Experience</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Guided Interaction:</strong> The interface is designed to guide visitors through a
                        series of questions. These questions help gather specific information about user
                        preferences,
                        dietary restrictions, and available ingredients. Users also have the option to let the bot
                        generate a random recipe.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Input Methods:</strong> Users can input their preferences through text fields,
                        checkboxes, and dropdown menus, making the interaction intuitive and user-friendly.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Backend Functionality</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prompt Generation:</strong> The answers provided by users are formatted into an
                        optimal
                        prompt. This prompt is the payload for the ChatGPT API, which is responsible for generating
                        the
                        recipe.</li>
                    <li><strong>ChatGPT API Integration:</strong> The platform integrates with the ChatGPT API to
                        fetch
                        custom recipes. The API returns the recipe in a structured JSON format, which includes
                        details
                        such as ingredients, quantities, step-by-step instructions, and cooking tips.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Security:</strong> The backend ensures the security and privacy of user data by
                        following best practices in data encryption and storage.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Post-Processing and Error Handling</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>JSON Output Correction:</strong> After receiving the recipe from the ChatGPT API, a
                        post-processing step is performed to correct potential errors in the JSON output. This
                        ensures the
                        recipe is properly displayed. Specific types of errors handled include formatting issues and
                        missing
                        data fields.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Enhancing User Engagement</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Image Generation:</strong> To create a more engaging user experience, an image is
                        generated
                        based on the title of the recipe. This is achieved by integrating the DALL-E API, which
                        provides a
                        visual representation of the final dish.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Appeal:</strong> The generated images are displayed alongside the recipe to
                        make the
                        presentation more appealing and to give users a better idea of the expected outcome.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Technical Stack and Tools</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frontend Development:</strong> The frontend is developed using Wix, incorporating
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive user interface.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend Development:</strong> The backend leverages Wix-Velo (JavaScript) to handle
                        API requests, data processing, and integration with external services like ChatGPT and
                        DALL-E
                        APIs. Additional libraries and tools used include Wix-Data for database operations and
                        Wix-Secrets
                        for secure storage of API keys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Version Control and Deployment:</strong> The development process uses Git for
                        version
                        control, ensuring efficient collaboration and management of code changes.</li>
