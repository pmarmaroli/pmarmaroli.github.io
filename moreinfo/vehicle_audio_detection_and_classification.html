                <h1>Acoustic-based Vehicle Detection and Classification</h1>
                <p>This project is a MATLAB-based system designed to detect and classify audio data, specifically
                    identifying passing by vehicle types like cars, trucks, and motorbikes.
                    The system performs real-time audio analysis using microphone array processing associated with deep
                    neural networks and provides visualization.</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The project aims to accurately detect and classify various vehicle types based on sound. It utilizes
                    custom-trained neural networks, where all data recording, training, and manual labeling were done
                    internally. The system classifies detected audio as one of several classes: "No Vehicles",
                    "Truck", "Car", or "Motorbike". It processes audio captured through microphone arrays and provides
                    real-time visual feedback to display probabilities and classifications.</p>

                <h2>User Interface and Experience</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-time Audio Input:</strong> Users can provide live audio input through a microphone
                        or select pre-recorded audio files for classification. The system processes audio using MATLAB's
                        `audioDeviceReader` for real-time capture, or `audioread` for file-based inputs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-time Visualization:</strong> The system displays real-time probability plots for
                        each detected class ("No Vehicles", "Truck", "Car", "Motorbike") and shows updated
                        classifications in response to incoming audio data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Webcam Integration:</strong> The webcam is used for taking screenshots during the
                        detection process, not for enhancing detection accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>Backend Functionality</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Custom-Trained Convolutional Neural Networks:</strong> The project utilizes CNN for
                        detection (multiple microphones) and classification (one microphone). All recording, training,
                        and manual labeling were
                        done internally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Microphone Array Processing:</strong> Detection is based on processing audio data from
                        a microphone array. The system uses cross-correlation to detect the evolution of signals over
                        time between pairs of microphones. More details can be found in <a

                            style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">this article</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Classification Layers:</strong> The classification layer converts the time signal into a
                        spectrogram, feeding a CNN to identify whether the audio matches any of the predefined vehicle
                        categories. I've made a similar demo of this technique which is visible on this <a

                <h2>Post-Processing and Error Handling</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-time Data Buffering:</strong> Audio data and classification results are buffered
                        and smoothed over time to provide stable and accurate probability plots. The visualizations
                        reflect both instantaneous and historical data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> The system checks for discrepancies in the audio input, such as
                        mismatched sampling rates, and handles these errors by resampling or prompting the user to
                        correct the input format.</li>
                </ul>
