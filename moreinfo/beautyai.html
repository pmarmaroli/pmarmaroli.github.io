                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> Utilized Sharp for image resizing to ensure optimal
                        dimensions for analysis. Images are converted to Base64 encoding for AI model processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Integration:</strong> Integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 model to analyze skin images and
                        generate detailed reports, including the severity of skin issues and recommended natural
                        solutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> Implemented file system operations to store intermediate data
                        like Base64 encoded images and JSON results. A cron job was set up to clear temporary data
                        periodically.</li>
                </ul>
