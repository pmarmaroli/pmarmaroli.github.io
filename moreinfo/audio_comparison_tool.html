                <h1>About the Audio Comparison Tool</h1>
                <p>This web application enables users to upload multiple audio files and switch between them for easy
                    comparative listening. The tool was designed for users who need a simple way to compare multiple
                    audio files, allowing easy playback and sharing of audio content via a shareable key system.</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p><strong>Audio Comparison Tool</strong> facilitates the seamless comparison of audio files through a
                    simple interface and interactive controls.</p>

                <h2>User Interface and Experience</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Audio Controls:</strong> Users can play, pause, and switch between different
                        audio files using an intuitive interface with waveform visualizations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Waveform Display:</strong> Each audio file is displayed with a visual waveform, giving
                        users more control over playback and navigation through the tracks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Creation:</strong> Users can create their own projects by uploading multiple
                        audio
                        files, which are organized under a unique project name for future reference and sharing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Selection:</strong> Users can select projects using a public key, allowing
                        others to
                        remotely access and listen to the uploaded audio files.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Backend Functionality</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Audio File Handling:</strong> Audio files are uploaded via the user interface, and the
                        server processes these files to make them available for comparison. The application supports
                        multiple
                        file uploads and different audio formats, with all audio files stored in Azure Storage
                        containers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Key Access:</strong> Users can choose a public key, similar to a password, which
                        they can share with others. This key is linked to their audio project, allowing other users to
                        access and listen to the shared audio files remotely by entering the provided key.</li>
                    <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> The backend handles API requests to retrieve audio files,
                        project data, and related labels for audio tagging from Azure Storage containers.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Post-Processing and Error Handling</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Audio Label Management:</strong> Users can upload label files created with Audacity to
                        tag specific time
                        segments in the audio files. These labels are processed and displayed on the waveform, providing
                        additional
                        context during playback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> The application includes robust error handling to manage
                        invalid public keys, failed audio uploads, and unsupported file formats.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Technical Stack and Tools</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frontend Development:</strong> The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                        incorporating WaveSurfer.js for audio visualization and control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend Development:</strong> The backend handles file uploads, project creation, and
                        API
                        requests to retrieve audio and label data. It is integrated with the public key system for user
                        access
                        control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> The server manages audio files and project data, ensuring that
                        files are accessible based on user input and public keys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> The application is deployed on the Azure (cloud) platform to handle
                        file storage and access for multiple users.</li>
                </ul>
