                <h1>About HadithGPT</h1>
                <p>The development of HadithGPT started in spring 2024 with the goal of creating an accessible platform
                    for
                    searching and reading Hadiths using modern LLM technologies. The project leverages language models
                    to
                    provide meaningful translations and interpretations of Hadiths, making them more accessible to a
                    global audience.</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p><strong>HadithGPT</strong> is an AI-powered platform designed to facilitate the search and retrieval
                    of Hadiths based on user queries. The development process focused on integrating advanced language
                    models to ensure accurate translations and efficient search capabilities.</p>

                <h2>User Interface and Experience</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Language Support:</strong> The platform supports both English and Arabic. The interface
                        dynamically adjusts based on the selected language.</li>
                    <li><strong>Search Functionality:</strong> Users can input their queries through a text field, and
                        the platform will retrieve the most relevant Hadiths based on the input. The search results are
                        displayed with detailed information about each Hadith.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>Backend Functionality</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Translation Integration:</strong> The platform uses translation APIs to convert Arabic
                        queries to English, ensuring broader accessibility. The translations are then processed by the
                        language models to find relevant Hadiths.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hadith Information Extraction:</strong> The backend processes Hadith data to extract
                        relevant information such as narrator, book title, author, and Hadith number, which are
                        displayed in the search results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> The system efficiently manages large datasets of Hadiths,
                        ensuring quick retrieval and accurate results.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Post-Processing and Error Handling</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>JSON Output Correction:</strong> After receiving search results, a post-processing step
                        ensures that the output is correctly formatted and complete, handling any errors in the data.
                    </li>
