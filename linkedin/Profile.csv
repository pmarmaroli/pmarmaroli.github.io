Patrick,Marmaroli,,,"Feb 6, 1984",Senior Audio Engineer at Microsoft | Tech Entrepreneur & Signal Processing Specialist | Founder at Vocametrix & Hidacs,"I am deeply interested in AI and audio signal processing, and I find great satisfaction in applying what I've learned to help solve real-world problems in areas such as industry, healthcare, security, and environmental sustainability.   Starting my career in academia with a PhD, I've transitioned through offering engineering services and participating in early-stage startups to now embracing a role within a large corporate company.  My curiosity and enthusiasm for technology have driven me to simultaneously explore several startup ideas alongside my primary employment.  In 2016, I took a step into the entrepreneurial world by co-founding Hidacs, a consulting company specializing in signal processing (www.hidacs.ch) for diverse industrial sectors. More recently, in 2023, I embarked on a new venture with Vocametrix (www.vocametrix.com), which aims to innovate in the field of speech therapy through the development of tools and games designed to enhance therapy outcomes.  These parallel entrepreneurial ventures have been profoundly enriching, equipping me with a broad spectrum of skills ranging from technical expertise to administrative acumen, alongside honing my abilities in teamwork, problem-solving, customer relationships and adaptability.  I am grateful for the journey so far and remain open to new learning opportunities, always hoping to contribute positively to the world through the intersection of technology and human need.","Technology, Information and Internet",,"Tallinn, Harjumaa, Estonia",,[PERSONAL:http://www.hidacs.ch],
