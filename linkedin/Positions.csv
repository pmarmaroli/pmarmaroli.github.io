Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne,PHD Student,"My doctoral research aimed to pioneer a cutting-edge, acoustics-based system to enhance real-time traffic monitoring. The focus was on creating a passive, compact, and non-intrusive system utilizing a few strategically placed microphones along the roadside. This approach significantly simplifies the installation process and minimizes the impact on traffic flow, contrasting sharply with traditional monitoring methods that often rely on multiple, complex setups.  The core of my thesis involved developing robust signal processing techniques that could accurately detect vehicles, estimate their speeds, and calculate their wheelbase lengths using sounds generated by tire-road interactions. These sounds were analyzed using advanced generalized cross-correlation functions among sensor pairs, leading to the development of a novel bimodal particle filter. This new filter variant was particularly adept at enhancing the robustness of speed estimations, even under difficult observational conditions, and was capable of accurately determining wheelbase lengths through passive acoustic measurements.  A unique aspect of my work was the practical validation of these developed algorithms. They were rigorously tested in real-world environments and their performance was benchmarked against standard radar systems and video monitoring techniques. The results demonstrated not only their viability but also their potential superiority in certain aspects of traffic monitoring.  Although my research was primarily focused on road traffic applications, the methodologies I devised have broader implications. They can potentially be adapted for use in rail, aerial, underwater, and industrial metrology settings, showcasing the versatility and far-reaching impact of this work.","Lausanne, Switzerland",Oct 2008,Feb 2013
